# DAX Index Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze and predict short-term movements of the DAX index using both traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The project is built in Python following an object-oriented programming paradigm and leverages multiple modules to fetch, preprocess, engineer features, train models, and visualize results.
